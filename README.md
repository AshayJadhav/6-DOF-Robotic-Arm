# 6-DOF-Robotic-Arm

This code contains algorithm for for the manipulation of 6 DOF Robotic Arm with a spherical wrist. The code takes the final coordinates as well as euler angles as input, calculates the Joint angles using forward and Inverse Kinematics and moves to that location. 
Also simulation is done to print letter R. Here, I have given a series of waverpoints for the arm, and the arm marks.
