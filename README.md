# 6-DOF-Robotic-Arm

This code contains the algorithm for for the manipulation of 6 DOF Robotic Arm with a spherical wrist. The code takes the final coordinates as well as Euler angles as input, calculates the Joint angles using forward and Inverse Kinematics, and moves to that location. 
Also, simulation is done to print the letter R. Here, I have given a series of waypoints for the arm, and the arm marks.
